## JoinNetwork use case

Deploy a quorum blockchain node using the shared information from a configuration repository. After the deployment, the public node information is uploaded to a chosen repository

Chart name: join-network <br/>
Plugin : join-network

### Joining Quorum Blockchain node deployment

#### Step 1: Clone your private config repository in the folder "private_configs"


1. After the repository was cloned, change the directory to the "private_configs" folder
```shell
cd private_configs
```
2. Create a folder which will represent your installation, like "network_name/charts/quorum-join-node-0" and change the directory to that folder
```shell
cd network_name/charts/quorum-join-node-0
```

#### Step 2: Install the helm chart and the plugin

1. Register the official, or the forked helm charts repository
```shell
helm repo add helm-charts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/axiologic-pla/helm-charts/master/charts/releases
```
2. Install the helm chart _join-network_
```shell
helm pull helm-charts/join-network --untar
```
3. Install the _join-network_ plugin
```shell
helm plugin install https://github.com/axiologic-pla/helm-charts/plugins/join-network
```

#### Step 3: Adjust private_configs/network_name/charts/quorum-join-node-0/join-network/values.yaml

The file contains parametrization for different sets of values:
1. specific data for the upload of the public shared information
2. specific data for the use case network, company name, public blockchain node endpoint and port
3. storage data used by the blockchain deployment
4. different annotations or configurations for the deployment

#### Step 4: Install the helm chart

1. Use the _join-network_ plugin to download the genesis file and generate the node cryptography. 
   The execution of the plugin will produce:
   1. _join-network.plugin.json_ file that will contain the downloaded genesis information and the generated node public crypto data. The json file will be used by the helm charts.
   2. _join-network.plugin.secrets.json_ file that will contain all the private information like private keys/passwords/etc. used for blockchain node cryptography.
   
```shell
helm join-network -i ./values.yaml -o .
```

2. Install the helm chart
```shell
helm install join-network . -f ./values.yaml
```

#### Step 5: Backup your installation and private information

Upload to your private repository all the data located in the folder _private_configs/network_name/charts/quorum-join-node-0_
